As a student on Team #3928 Neutrino, I have spent 1600+ hours on the Design, Manufacture, Assembly, Upkeep, and Coaching of competitive robots. Through this experience, I have learned valuable leadership, communication skills as well as mechanical skills.

The game Dominion really piqued my interest because every single game is different, 10 different cards selected from a pool of 426 kingdom cards or 1.77 * 10^26 possible kingdoms. This quickly became a preoccupation of mine, placing 4th in the 2018 Dominion World Championship. Recently, I have been integrating my old love for Dominion with my new passion for coding with a new project

I love learning new technologies, programing languages, and new enviroments. It gives me a different set of tools to look at the same problem. It helps me get a deeper understanding of the underlying problems that I face as a programer.

From my start in the humble state of Iowa, I have traveled to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Haiti, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Through those experiences, I have seen how different people, communities and cultures solve a the set of problems that we all face in life.

Through these experiences, I have developed a real passion for solving problems, and would love to help you solve yours.
