# Hi
It's me, Simeon Steward.

As the third of four brothers, growing up, it was often a competition at who would be the best. Who would be the tallest, strongest and who would be the best at a given board or card game. When our family got the game Dominion, I knew that I wanted to win against my two older brothers. So I began to study the game. At first it was just to be better than them, but I quickly discovered the wider competitive dominion scene. Dominion is a very interesting game because every single game is different, with 10 different cards selected from a pool of 426 kingdom cards or 1.77 * 10^26 possible kingdoms. Hours and Hours were spent on this passion, eventually placing 4th in the 2018 Dominion World Championship. Recently, I have revived my interest in dominion, and have been developing a dominion simulator in rust.

Both my older brothers did robotics in high school, so naturally, I was excited as I entered high school. Under the second brother's tutelage, I learned the ropes, in particular the design and manufacture of robots. As a student on Team #3928 Neutrino, I have spent 1600+ hours on the Design, Manufacture, Assembly, Upkeep, and Coaching of competitive robots. This experience was invaluable in helping to become a better leader, team member and thinker, as each challenge we faced was unique yet built on previous knowledge.

You might ask "If you were doing so well with mechanical design, why did you switch to programming?" I took a couple of programming classes at Iowa State while I was still in high school, and I really loved it. Just seeing your code finally work how you intend, as well as the fact that I can do so many different projects without having to buy really expensive machinery was really compelling.

I really have enjoyed my time at Iowa State, I have met so many truly interesting people, I have mentored several people, and have been on the leadership team of both Salt company and the navigators christian student ministries. 

## To be continued...

<!-- I love learning new technologies, programing languages, and new enviroments. It gives me a different set of tools to look at the same problem. It helps me get a deeper understanding of the underlying problems that I face as a programer.

From my start in the humble state of Iowa, I have traveled to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Haiti, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Through those experiences, I have seen how different people, communities and cultures solve a the set of problems that we all face in life.

Through these experiences, I have developed a real passion for solving problems, and would love to help you solve yours. -->
